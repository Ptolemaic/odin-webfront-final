# The Odin Project - Web Development 101

<h3>JS/jQuery Front End - Drawing Grid</h3>

  This is a personal project done for training and as an example of basic UI/UX and JS/jQuery. The original project specification can be found at this location: http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery
  
  I have followed the spirit of the specification but disagree with some of their design choices, such as the use of interruptive popups for input. For this reason my project deviates from a strict implementation. Since this was my first project with JS/jQuery I took the liberties to get a little creative and tweak the design to my liking.
