<h2>The Odin Project: JS/jQuery Front End</h2>

  This is a personal project done for training and as an example of core UI/UX skill sets. The original project specification can be found at this location: http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery
  
  I have followed the spirit of the specification but disagree with some of their design choices, such as the use of interruptive popups for input. For this reason my project deviates from a strict implementation, but since this was my first exposure to JS/jQuery I took the liberties to get a little creative and tweak the design to my liking.
